1 unable to check victory screen when performing lighthouse sword operation
after the window has been resized

2 error when sending a march out when all march queues are occupied

[solved] 3 from lighthouse UI the location of the view button moves based on the tier of sword battle selected

4 when selecting the image_lighthouse icon the "reward center" button may be pressed
[fix attempt].1 divide the width of the search area by 2 so that the reward center icon is not in it. 

5 reader.py failes to read march times of 00:00:38, 00:00:29
[failed][fix attempt].1 slightly enlarge the screenshot to the right by .01 relative location points
[failed][fix attempt].2 apply interpolation and improve resolution of image * 10
[failed][fix attempt].3 using interpolation from attempt 2 remove color channels other than blue
[Solved][fix attempt].4 use the PIL and tesseract based reader function as a stopgap if the cv2 based function
returns ""
	solution for time 00:00:29 works. More testing for other times needed. 
	solution failed for march time of 00:00:14

6 Image_Rec function Swipe failes when the exploration collect button falls on the center of the screen

note - maybe make windows same size as test window: WL (550, 951) so icons are the same size for image rec
